    <h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <h3 class="underline">1. OVERVIEW</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a. Topic</li>
        <p>- Our project is about a website game called Escape Room. This is a puzzle, adventurous, intellectual game that helps the players to practice critical thinking and gain a wide range of knowledge, ranging from social, science, technology... and even soft skills such as survival skill, teamwork, communication, to be able to find the right “key” to open the door and escape the room. All in all, we use technology to create a website game which incorporates a vast number of educational elements, going hand in hand with entertainment elements. The game Escape Room will be shown to Vietnamese children and adults, for them to learn and widen their skill and knowledge without any constraint, which we believe will be a huge advantage in learning when they can learn while they are entertaining.</p>
        <p>- The outcome of our project will offer various types of virtual escape rooms, with user-friendly interfaces, so that the players can stay engaged and be able to collaborate, creatively imagine and find answers to escape the rooms. Another outcome of this project will be for us to receive feedback from the players, further developments will be made for our game to thrive, changes such as enhancements in customer experience while playing our game, including visual experience, full functionality website, clear and simple interface to navigate.</p>

        <li>b. Motivation:</li>
        <p>- Currently, one of the IT trends is game-based learning (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/13/2/183">https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/13/2/183</a>). So, the motivations for us to create this project are following the trends of IT world and bringing value to people, children and young adult specifically. Firstly, this is a trend, as mentioned, learning while playing has long been a great way to learn and practice in a stress-free environment. This way of learning is suitable for children because it will help them concentrate more than learning by book and board. Secondly, we believe that there is much more knowledge to learn beyond school and textbook, so with a huge number of youngsters having smartphone and tablet, this game can bring to them more knowledge and perspective of the world around them, which can help them practice survival skill and to find their interests and passion in their early age, this will have huge advantages on the young generation. And our personal motivation is to become a web developer, so doing this project will give us opportunities to be able to build full-stack, including front-end and back-end, we can also get to know proficiency in user-interface, put ourselves in customers’ shoes to know the user-experience. This project ultimately is successful in terms of its functional development, that highlights our technical and soft skills to attract employers.  </p>
       
        <li>c. Landscape</li>
        <p>- Surprisingly, Vietnamese games only account 12% of 739 million USD online gaming industry in Vietnam. Most of the games are import from other countries (https://www.viettonkinconsulting.com/global-business/the-potential-of-the-gaming-industry-in-vietnam/). There are some similar games to our project, such as The Escaper, The Room Three, The Office Quest, to mention a few (<a href="https://motgame.vn/top-12-game-escape-giai-do-thoat-phong-hay-nhat-tren-mobile-danh-cho-nguoi-luoi-van-dong-c4.game">https://motgame.vn/top-12-game-escape-giai-do-thoat-phong-hay-nhat-tren-mobile-danh-cho-nguoi-luoi-van-dong-c4.game</a>). Their products are mobile games, which require downloading process. There are direct competitors to our project, GameVui.vn for example, also have escape game amongst other game genres. Our advantages are firstly, we concentrate on develop an online escape game which can be easily accessed. Secondly, our game will have the depth of educational elements with further research on which topics and information we should provide to our players to benefits the community, for example, how to survive from house fires or how to keep a green and healthy environment, since the community’s awareness of this topic is still low. Thirdly, we will do our best to provide the players with the most exciting visual and sound that keeping them engage. Also, we will listen closely to players’ feedback so that we can enhance their experience on our website.</p>

    <h3 class="underline">2. DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>a. Aims</li>
        <p>- Our aim for this project is to offer learning experience for the player, not only for students but also for those who want to gain more knowledge and skills that incorporate in our game. Currently, more and more children and youngsters are having access to internet and the gaming industry is booming, not to mention the Ministry of Information and Communication in Vietnam recently supported esports and game industry in Vietnam (https://vietnamnet.vn/en/ministry-to-help-expand-markets-for-make-in-vietnam-games-2111646.html). With our value of knowledge provided with a user-friendly, engaging interface website, the players of our game will surely be having a good leisure time playing our game and learning new things. 
            Our first and primary goal is to create an engaging interface of our website, so that the user can be willing to stay and explore it. To do that, we need to create a simple to use website, yet mysterious to create a sense of curiosity. After the first impression of a catchy interface, we need to distinguish our game from other escape games. To do that, we need to create every game in our system a little different from others. For instance, we will put the rooms in the context of Vietnam, with Vietnamese issues and questions asked on how to solve those issues. This can create familiarities for Vietnamese player and curiosity for foreign players. To completely achieve this goal, we need our web developers to have the ability to create such website and our R&D team to research on the context of Vietnam, issues of Vietnamese people, ... 
            </p>
        <p>- Our second goal is to create realistic, interesting questions that fit the context of the room, delivering valuable knowledge to the player while they are playing. To do this, we will need a Research & Development team to constantly looking at the context of Vietnam or places where we implement our game, research on global issues, or any gap in the knowledge provided by school system...to incorporate in our game, giving the players knowledge and skills that they have yet to know. By doing so, the players will catch the value we deliver regarding social skill ranging from survival skills to academic knowledge. </p>

        <li>b. Plans and Progress</li>
        <p>- In assignment 2, our team discuss on what we should do, whether to create a web game or a website to find teammate. After discussing and brainstorming, we came up with the Escape Room idea because of its potential: an engaging and educational game. After research on this topic, we became more excited on this idea because of the context of game industry in Vietnam, the trend of educational elements incorporated in games, we get together to discuss what should our website look like, what kind of knowledge should be include in our game. At the beginning of the project, we thought that we would build a normal escape room game, but then we came up with the idea of incorporating educational elements, specifically in Vietnam context, in the game, will make it much better in terms of engagement and the games’ value. And that will be the point to differentiate us from others escape game that had already existed on the market. And we insist that we need to create an appealing interface for the players to enjoy and engage with our game. That will be the hard part for the developers, since this is new to them, and they will have to put in a lot of work and effort to create the desired interface. 
            We then dived in to plan for which part of website needed to be done so that our project can come to life. After having clear picture of how our website will look like, how it is going to function. Jobs are divided to teams’ members. Nghia is responsible for the header of the website, Vong will do the body and the content of the website and Nghi will take care of the footer of the web interface, Nam will follow up on the developers and write the reports. At first, the developers were all completely new to this area, so Vong, Nghia and Nghi had to do quite a lot of research and fast learning about CSS. HTML and JavaScript, this was where Vong found some useful sources to learn about his field outside of school.  
            Nghi decided to use html to build the website and Vong suggested that team use GitHub to track the progress of the project. In the process of building the website, our developers had no conflict but find it difficult to figure out how to design the interface of the web. We then discuss again on the educational elements of our game and found out that we forget an important aspect of it which is survival skill the player gains while playing our game. Thanks to Vong, we have incorporated survival elements into our game. After developers of our team finalize the web game, Nam based on the website to write the final report. He got stuck anywhere that have technical or practical knowledge required. However, our team always help each other out and try our best to do this project.

        <li>f. Testing</li>
        <p>- Only after we finished our game, we will alpha test it by playing it internally by our developers and our colleagues. Us and our testers will provide feedback on what to change, how it can improve, specifically on user's interface, function features, and whole performance of the game. After the inner circle of our project tested and make improvements, we will release it to the early adopters to take the next step to beta testing. This will need marketer to target to children and young adults to try our game. Here we will provide an additional chat box for the players to provide feedback in form of surveys with questions and multiple-choice answers to test their satisfaction with our game, their expectations and experiences before, during and after they enter the escape room. From that we fall back to anywhere that have error or misconceptions to make improvements. </p>

        <li>h. Risks</li>
        <p>- Our project’s first risk is that it will not be as we expected. Since this is new to us and we do not have enough skill and knowledge to build a complete game website. So that will lead to the problem of our game is not completely built as planned. And the function of our website might not be easy to use since we all are freshman, and the website is at a beginner level. However, thankfully we had no problems using VSCode or GitHub because of the hard-working of the developers so the process of making the first viable website front-end did not got stuck. </p>
        <p>- Accordingly, our propose on user engagement will also be at risks since the web interface is not at it best. Users might see our website easy to use but however, a little boring. Although all of it functions are good to use but it does not give the user the experience they might have on other games, such as the sound when you click on our buttons, interesting links between one function and another to keep the user appeal.  </p>
        <p>- Accuracy of the content is another risk of our project, since we have limitation on human resources for researching so the content of our project might be at a surface level, to get to a deeper level of content, we need more time and resources. </p>
        <p>- Game competitors are surely our last but most important risk, since they have already entered the field and gain their players, it will be a risk for us to launch our game when we have not solved all the risks mentioned above. </p>

        <li>i. Groups process and communications</li>
        <p>- We communication both online and offline. We meet at the coffee shop once a week to discuss ideas and for project manager to assign task to the team members. Video call through Teams is our way of communicating online, we do this once a week to keep track of the progress and to help each other out when someone get stuck. Every time someone absent from team’s meeting, Nghi will be the one to briefly deliver the meeting main points to the absent one. Throughout the process of doing this project, we had no problem regarding communication and process of doing the tasks.  </p>
